    "# An Example Jupyter Notebook for Greylevel Analysis of Active Cathode Particles in X-ray CT tomograms \n",
    "Here we present a method for analysing the greylevel change in active cathode particles in their pristine state and after ageing. When aged Nickel Manganese Cobalt particles crack, resulting in changes in greylevel when imaged with X-ray CT. Typically, particles crack more in the center than at the surface. In this notebook we demonstrate how to use the GRAPES (Grey-level Analysis of Particles) toolkit (`utils/GRAPES.py`) to analyse this phenomenon."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "The `GRAPES` toolkit can be used characterize greylevel change and other particle level characteristics in X-ray CT datasets of particles. In this case relatively small 256 x 256 x 256 volumes were used, however, this method works best with larger volumes. For a more detailed description of the electrochemical imaging use-case see this [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/smtd.202500082)."
